# Coordination Board — China4 project

Shared task board for parallel agent sessions. Claim a task by writing your
session ID and file scope, then commit and push immediately. Never start a task
another session has claimed. Keep scopes non-overlapping. Small, frequent commits;
run `git pull --rebase` before every push. When a task is finished, record
sources, verification performed, and irregularities here and mark it done.

Session ID for this session: `agent-1` (branch `arena/c56cf052-china4`)
